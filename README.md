## NFL Team Blog Sentiment Analysis

In this project, I will be using Selenium in Python to programmatically harvest old blog posts for a specific NFL team community. I will be using the text of these blogposts as predictor data to see if the sentiments expressed in the blogs posted in the week prior to games have predictive value for forecasting the outcomes of the games. Some proprietary data (blog names/links and other data) will be kept out of the repository.

Some of the tools I'll be using to execute this project:

- Selenium in Python for webscraping
- SQLite3 database for relational database operations
- NLP techniques to prepare data for predictions via sentiment
- DL model to perform predicitons
